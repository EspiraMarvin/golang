### Collection types - Arrays and Slices

#### Arrays
- In GO, arrays are considered values and not references/pointers types to the arrays (they don't refer to the same underlying data 
) unlike slices
- You can perform slice operations

 Creation
 Built-in functions - [length(len(a)), slice, ]
 working with Arrays

#### Slices
- In GO, slice are references/pointers types, they refer to the same underlying data 
- You can perform slice operations
 Creation
 Built-in functions -[length(len(a)), capacity(cap(a)) slice, make]
 working with Slices
