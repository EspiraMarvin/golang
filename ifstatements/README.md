#### operators 
    -----
    eg of comparison
    number <= guess
    number >= guess
    number != guess

- Note: you should not test to see if 2 floating numbers are equal to one another

##### NOTES:
- short-circuiting 
        - Go stops executing the remaining OR conditions if it has gotten a one true condition
        - Go stops executing the remaining AND conditions if it has gotten a one false condition

## Switch statements

#### simple cases
#### Cases with multiple tests
#### Falling through
#### Type switches
