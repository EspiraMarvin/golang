### Maps & Structs

#### Maps
- What they are
- Creation
- Manipulation 
    - adding to a map,
    - deletion 
    - selecting item from a map
    - finding how aman elements are their in a map len(map)

##### Notes:
- bool, strings,all the numeric types, pointers, interfaces, channels structs, arrays can be tested for equality checking (string type == another string type) except slices, maps and other functions
- An array is a valid key type but not a slice
- Arrays and slice returns items in the order we ordered them, but a map doesn't guarantee an order in which we created

#### Structs
- What they are
- Creation
- Naming conventions
- Embedding
